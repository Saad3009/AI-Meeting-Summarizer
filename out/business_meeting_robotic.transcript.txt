manager, good morning, thanks for joining on time.
 Let's keep this short.
 How are we progressing on the client dashboard?
 Team member, good morning.
 The main feature is in place, and testing is ongoing.
 We might identify the few bugs in the reporting module, but those should be fixed by tomorrow.
 Manager, at Stodter here.
 Are we still on track to deliver the memo by Friday?
 Team member, yes, the timeline looks realistic.
 Once the fix is done, I'll run around on testing, and prepare the slides for the client.
 Manager, perfect.
 Please also make sure not you impatiently updated.
 I'll review everything first day after noon so we're ready for the memo.
 Team member, understood.
 I'll handle that and confirm once it's done.
 Manager, great, thanks.
 A sore from my side today.
